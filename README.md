# Everest - Rapid Development PHP Framework
 Hooks is a rapid development PHP MVC framework. It encompasses the MVC with partials and view components. It has in-built Database Helpers that help you develop apps in PHP rapidly.

# The idea
I was a very big fan of the MVC-framework implemented by ASP.Net. This framwork implements very similar pattern and should be familiar to ASP.Net developers.

# Installation
- Using composer: `composer create-project everest-php/everest`
- Using git: `git clone https://github.com/everest-php/everest.git`
- Or simply, download this repositoy as zip.
